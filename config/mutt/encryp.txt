Procedure to get the signing with GRIDFR certificate working
(not sure that's the simplest way, but it worked...)

Get the 3 CA certificates (from https://igc.services.cnrs.fr/search_CA_certificate/?CA=GRID2-FR&lang=fr&body=view_ca.html)

CNRS2-Projects.crt
CNRS2.crt
GRID2-FR.crt

convert them to pem :

openssl x509 -in CNRS2.crt -out CNRS2.pem
openssl x509 -in CNRS2-Projets.crt -out CNRS2-Projets.pem
openssl x509 -in GRID2-FR.crt -out GRID2-FR.pem

and merge them into a single "chain" file :

cat *.pem > cachain.pem

convert the personal certificate (cert+key in fact) .p12 into a pem as well :

openssl pkcs12 -in certificate-grid2-fr.p12 -out mycert.pem

and finally append the full certification chain to the personal certificate into another p12 file (mycert.p12)

openssl pkcs12 -in mycert.pem -out mycert-complete.p12 -export -certfile cachain.pem

That's the final .p12 we import to mutt :

smime_keys add_p12 mycert-complete.p12 

(see e.g. https://github.com/ThomasAdam/mutt/blob/master/doc/smime-notes.txt or
https://pthree.org/2011/09/15/setting-up-mutt-with-smime-and-pgpmime/ or
https://kb.wisc.edu/middleware/page.php?id=4091)

in particular, must have the ca-bundle.crt installed in $HOME/.smime first and . then use smime_keys add_root for the 3
cnrs ca : the add_root command adds to the ca-bundle.crt file...
